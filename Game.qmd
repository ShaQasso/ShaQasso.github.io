## About the Game

This is a browser-based microbiome game I built using Gemini 3.\
It focuses on diversity, fitness, and host defense.

You can play it here:

*(Opens in a new tab)*

The game was generated iteratively using Gemini 3, with custom prompts for gameplay mechanics, balancing, and artwork. I modified the event logic and diversity dynamics manually to keep it scientifically inspired and hopefully, fun.
